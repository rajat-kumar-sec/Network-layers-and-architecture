# 🌐 Introduction to Networking: Core Concepts & Protocols

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to the fundamental building blocks of modern computer networks. [cite_start]The included documentation is designed to provide a clear understanding of how data moves across the globe, from physical hardware to high-level applications.

## 📑 What's Covered?

### 1. Network Foundations
* [cite_start]**Definition:** A set of devices (nodes) connected by communication links to share resources like files and internet access[cite: 28, 29].
* [cite_start]**Components:** Detailed breakdown of Nodes (PCs, Servers), Links (Fiber, Wi-Fi), and Topologies (Star, Mesh, etc.)[cite: 31, 32, 33].

### 2. Theoretical vs. Practical Models
* [cite_start]**OSI Model:** An in-depth look at the 7-layer conceptual framework, from the Physical Layer to the Application Layer[cite: 35, 36, 43].
* [cite_start]**TCP/IP Suite:** The practical 4-layer model that governs the modern internet, including the Network Access, Internet, Transport, and Application layers[cite: 45, 46, 47].

### 3. Essential Protocols
* [cite_start]**Reliability:** The difference between **TCP** (connection-oriented/reliable) and **UDP** (connectionless/fast)[cite: 56, 58].
* [cite_start]**Services:** Key protocols including **DNS** (naming), **HTTP/HTTPS** (web), **DHCP** (auto-IP), and **ARP** (address resolution)[cite: 60, 61, 62, 63].

### 4. Infrastructure & Addressing
* [cite_start]**Hardware:** The functional roles of **Switches** (MAC-based), **Routers** (IP-based), and **Firewalls** (Security)[cite: 65, 66, 67].
* [cite_start]**IP Addressing:** A guide to **IPv4**, **IPv6**, and the mechanics of **Subnet Masks**[cite: 69, 70, 71, 72].
